                        Born and raised in Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya, I grew up amidst a vibrant culture, bustling markets, and beautiful parks. My childhood was filled with explorations of the city’s attractions, such as the Nairobi National Park, sparking my curiosity and love for nature.

                        Family gatherings were a staple, often held at home or local restaurants. These moments, brimming with laughter, stories, and the flavors of Kenyan cuisine, instilled in me a strong sense of community and belonging.

                        Nairobi, known as the “Silicon Savannah” due to its burgeoning tech scene, played a pivotal role in shaping my career aspirations. This exposure to the tech environment inspired my interest in technology and motivated me to pursue a career in the tech industry.
